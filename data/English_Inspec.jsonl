Despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners, ensemble methods have not been widely adopted in structure-activity and structure-property correlation.

Recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models, ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors. In this work, we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, as applied to QSAR and QSPR. Although aggregation does offer definitive advantages, we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results. These findings are rationalized using Krogh and Vedelsby's (1995) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them.

However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to, improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to log in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in experiment I and eight characters in experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in. For the five-character passwords, 75% were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33% with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17% were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5% with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed", "keyphrases": ["comput secur", "user authent", "proactiv password check", "proactiv password restrict", "length restrict", "five-charact password", "eight-charact password"]}

A novel technique for multi-scale curvature computation on a free-form 3-D surface is presented. This is achieved by convolving local parametrisations of the surface with 2-D Gaussian filters iteratively. In our technique, semigeodesic coordinates are constructed at each vertex of the mesh. Smoothing results are shown for 3-D surfaces with different shapes indicating that surface noise is eliminated and surface details are removed gradually. A number of evolution properties of 3-D surfaces are described. Next, the surface Gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly on the surface. The performance of the technique when selecting different directions as an arbitrary direction for the geodesic at each vertex are also presented. The results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of Gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration. Furthermore, as the surface is smoothed iteratively, the error is further reduced. The results also show that the estimation error of Gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature. Our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates. Our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2-D rather than 3-D convolutions are employed.

The essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics.

It is shown that the appearance of large amplitude, stable limit cycles occurs due to a \"false\" bifurcation or canard explosion. The subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow, namely, a saddle connection.

Management science Ph.D.s are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program, having more experience and interest in algorithms than management.

The work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of Zimbabwe, which includes a crop production component for yields of maize, small grains and groundnuts. Only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. This spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables, representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards. For each ward, log-transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation, which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations. A covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards. Sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad. Cross-validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well.

If labor archivists are to be successful, they must find their collective voice within the labor movement and establish their relevancy to unions during a period of momentous change and restructuring.

We introduce and study an artificial neural network inspired by the probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction. Our system consists of N sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing linear threshold element. The system's aim is to model discrimination of a single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants within a range of odorant concentrations. We show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value p/sub c/ and calculate the critical capacity alpha c=p/sub c//N. The critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished. If the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements, each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant, our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb. The mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the capacity for linear separability of continuous curves, embedded in a large-dimensional space. This is accomplished here by a numerical study, using a method that signals whether the discrimination task is realizable, together with a finite-size scaling analysis", "keyphrases": ["artifici neural network", "receptor affin distribut", "olfact", "linear threshold element", "sensori neuron", "linear separ", "odor discrimin"]}

This paper presents a new approach for watermarking of digital images providing robustness to geometrical distortions. The weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first.

An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark, invariant properties of transforms, template insertion, or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter, a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression, geometrical attack and transformations.

{"file_name": "375.abstr", "text": "Separation and tracking of multiple broadband sources with one electromagnetic vector sensor. A structure for adaptively separating, enhancing and tracking uncorrelated sources with an electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) is presented. The structure consists of a set of parallel spatial processors, one for each individual source. Two stages of processing are involved in each spatial processor. The first preprocessing stage rejects all other sources except the one of interest, while the second stage is an adaptive one for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tracking the desired source. The preprocessings are designed using the latest source parameter estimates obtained from the source trackers, and a redesign is activated periodically or whenever any source has been detected by the source trackers to have made significant movement.

An information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system. But usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation. In this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency. One system is a legacy, text-based system with cumbersome navigation (RMS); the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation (CopNet). It is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate CopNet higher than RMS, but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will. We conducted two user studies. One study examined what users thought of RMS and CopNet, and compared RMS experts' evaluations with nonexperts. We found that all users evaluated CopNet as more effective, easier to use, and easier to navigate than RMS, and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system. The second, follow-up study examined use behavior after CopNet was deployed some time later. The findings revealed that evaluations of CopNet were not associated with its use. If the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older, legacy system, why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch?

We propose a fully three-dimensional (3-D) object-based coding system exploiting the diagnostic relevance of the different regions of the volumetric data for rate allocation. The data are first decorrelated via a 3-D discrete wavelet transform. The implementation via the lifting steps scheme allows to map integer-to-integer values, enabling lossless coding, and facilitates the definition of the object-based inverse transform. The coding process assigns disjoint segments of the bitstream to the different objects, which can be independently accessed and reconstructed at any up-to-lossless quality. Two fully 3-D coding strategies are considered: embedded zerotree coding (EZW-3D) and multidimensional layered zero coding (MLZC), both generalized for region of interest (ROI)-based processing. In order to avoid artifacts along region boundaries, some extra coefficients must be encoded for each object. This gives rise to an overheading of the bitstream with respect to the case where the volume is encoded as a whole. The amount of such extra information depends on both the filter length and the decomposition depth. The system is characterized on a set of head magnetic resonance images.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference (ISI) always occurs. The conventional OFDM system provides advantages through conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free subchannels at multiple frequency bands. However, it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion. Previously, a new OFDM framework, the precoded OFDM, has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free vector channels. In this paper, we consider the application of the precoded OFDM system to efficient scalable video transmission. We propose to enhance the precoded OFDM system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. The more critical layers, or equivalently, the lower layers, are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality. The channel quality is characterized by Frobenius norm metrics; based on channel estimation at the receiver. The channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel.

While the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far-field diffraction, they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration. Therefore the derivation of the far-field diffraction for a single aperture cannot be applied to a mask with periodic apertures. The far-field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past, the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design. We study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it.

Partial order theory (POT) is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds, based on selected structural and/or electronic descriptors (modeled order), or based on their end points, , solubility (experimental order). If the modeled order resembles the experimental order, compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the model that eventually might lead to a prediction of an end-point value. However, in the application of POT in quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling, only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied. To explore the possibilities of improving the methodology, the theory is extended by application of the so-called linear extensions of the model order.

With the recent introduction of navigation techniques in orthopaedic surgery, a new field of application has been opened. Today surgical navigation systems - also known as image-guided surgery systems - are available for various applications in orthopaedic surgery. They visualize the position and orientation of surgical instruments as graphical overlays onto a medical image of the operated anatomy on a computer monitor. Preoperative image data such as computed tomography scans or intra operatively generated images (for example, ultrasonic, endoscopic or fluoroscopic images) are suitable for this purpose. A new category of medical images termed 'surgeon-defined anatomy' has been developed that exclusively relies upon the usage of navigation technology.

Many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created, creating new primitives with good aspect ratios, avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path, and representing the path traversed by the tool as accurately as possible.

In many imaging applications, it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beam-steering components (i.e., mirrors and gimbals) with a nonmechanical device. One such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array (LCOPA). An LCOPA can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light. However, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. First, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles, causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. Second, the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order, but to others as well. This multiple-order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane.

Based on this storage approach, one has to determine, for each given batch of data blocks, from which disk each of the data blocks is to be retrieved. This is to be done in such a way that the maximum load of the disks is minimized. The problem is called the retrieval selection problem (RSP).

In order to assess the possible time-varying properties of renal autoregulation, time-frequency and time-scaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broad-band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and single-nephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive (Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and Long-Evans) rats, and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Time-frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single-nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanisms have time-varying characteristics. Furthermore, we utilized the Renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood-flow dynamics in the time-frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings. We found a clear difference in Renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced (p < 0.037) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations (p < 0.033), and at the single-nephron level (p < 0.008). Especially at the single-nephron level, the mean Renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats, suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition. To further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms, we employed multiresolution wavelet transform. Our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms, the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats. The separation of the scales at the myogenic and TGF frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with 100% accuracy.

The main contribution of this work is a new paradigm for image representation and image compression. We describe a new multilayered representation technique for images.

During each iteration of the algorithm, we code the residual part in a lossy way: we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part, which results in a sparse representation. Each layer is encoded independently with a different transform, or basis, at a different bitrate, and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way. The strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others: some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data, while others will catch the local transients, or the oscillatory patterns.

Selection of the best set of scales is problematic when developing signal-driven approaches for pixel-based image segmentation. Often, different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade-off between uncertainty (variance) and location accuracy. The optimal set of scales depends on several factors: the noise level present in the image material, the prior distribution of the different types of segments, the class-conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the (connected) segments. We analyse, theoretically and through experiments, the possibility of using the overall and class-conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces. It is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account. However, a uniform (ignorant) prior distribution ensures constant class-conditional error rates. Consequently, we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted, scale-invariant segmentation approach is desired. Experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) images, acquired with a paramagnetic tracer, support the theoretical results. Furthermore, the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier, extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces, improves the segmentation result compared to a signal-driven approach based solely on the dynamic MR signal.

Using the DQM, the frequency-domain Telegrapher's partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations. DQM reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain. Although the rationalization process in DQM is comparable with the Pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) applied to transmission lines, the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different. Unlike AWE, which employs a complex moment-matching process to obtain rational approximation, the DQM requires no approximation of transcendental functions, thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching.

Consequently, optimal processing according to several standard IT criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if the parameters are \"tuned\" to values that correspond to one and the same QFR.

Using simple acoustical and mechanical models, we consider the conceptual possibility of designing an active absorbing (nonreflecting) coating in the form of a thin layer with small-scale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters. Algorithms for space-time modulation of the controlled-layer structure are studied in detail for a one-dimensional boundary-value problem. These algorithms do not require wave-field measurements, which eliminates the self-excitation problem that is characteristic of active systems. The majority of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the low-frequency incident wave to high-frequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque (absorbing). The efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms. It is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval (starting from zero frequency) that is bounded from above only by a finite space-time resolution of the parameter-control operations. The structure of a three-dimensional parametric \"'black\" coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied one-dimensional problems.

Positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information on tumor biology, but lacks detailed anatomical information. Our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck. Three difficulties in achieving this goal are (1) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations; (2) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods; and (3) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results. These problems are solved as follows: accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask. The proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan. To obtain sufficient (anatomical) information for matching, two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol. A mutual information-based algorithm was used as a registration technique. PET and CT data were obtained in seven patients. Each patient had two CT scans and one PET scan. The datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching PET to CT/sub 1/, CT/sub 1/ to CT/sub 2/, and CT/sub 2/ to PET using the full circle consistency test. It was found that using our method, consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 1.3 degrees on average. The PET voxels used for registration were 5.15 mm, so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size. Cropping the images (removing the scanner bed from images) did not improve the consistency of the algorithm.

For an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences, a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required.

We propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow. By observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance, chrominance, gradient density, and geometry domains, a combined probability map, called a shadow confidence score (SCS), is obtained. From the edge map of the input image, each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring SCSs. The cast shadow is identified as those regions with high SCSs, which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels. The proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions (sunny and cloudy), viewing angles (roadside and overhead), vehicle sizes (small, medium, and large), and colors (similar to the road and not).

In the paper, a radial basis function neural networks identification model of a MCFC stack is developed based on the input-output sampled data.

A novel bitline sensing scheme is proposed for low-voltage DRAM to achieve low power dissipation and compatibility with low-voltage CMOS.

It also improves die efficiency, because the proposed scheme reduces the number of sense amplifiers by supporting more cells in each sense amplifier.

{"file_name": "204.abstr", "text": "Self-calibration from image derivatives. This study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters, where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole-camera model. The equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters. A set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow, and from these parameters the calibration can be determined. However, as for discrete motion, in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components. Geometrically, the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component, and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation. In general, for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary, with the 3D rotation changing between the measurements. The geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self-calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements. New constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives, and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated. The calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields. As the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks, or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases", "keyphrases": ["camera calibr paramet", "imag motion field", "rigidli move camera", "imag format", "linear pinhole-camera model", "calibr paramet", "imag measur", "translat compon", "rotat compon", "direct self-calibr method", "optic flow", "point correspond", "normal flow measur", "activ vision system", "imag sequenc", "larg video databas", "depth distort"]}
