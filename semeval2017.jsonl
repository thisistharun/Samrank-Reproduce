To address the issue of reduced etch resistance of thin photoresist films the semiconductor industry has begun to develop multilayer processes where the pattern is first transferred into an intermediate organic hardmask with higher etch selectivity before final silicon pattern transfer [25\u201327]. In this paper we demonstrate how the introduction of such a multilayer process can also benefit nanosphere lithography by increasing achievable aspect ratios of silicon nanopillars without the need for complex etch processes requiring specialised and expensive equipment, but instead needing only a standard SF6/C4F8 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mixed mode etch process at room temperature [28]. As intermediate layer material we used polyimide, which finds widespread use as encapsulation material for IC production. It is readily patterned in oxygen plasma and has a lower etch rate than silicon in SF6 gas. Its flexibility can also be used for the fabrication of soft polymer pillars by the same process as we will show.

The major purpose of this study is to provide a fundamental concept for modelling physicochemical processes of the gas exchange, followed by the chemical reaction in water. Demonstrating fundamental data and knowledge on the important environmental transport phenomena, especially the effects of the Schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms across the interface have also been attempted. The gas exchange processes are separated into two physicochemical substeps, the first is the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium between the two phases, and the second is the chemical reaction in the water phase. A first-order, irreversible chemical reaction of the gaseous material after its uptake into the water phase is assumed here to simplify interactions of the chemical reactions and turbulent transport phenomena in water. While a traditional two-compartment model assumes uniform concentration of a material in each compartment, the present two-compartment model uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique in the water compartment to evaluate temporal development of three-dimensional profiles of the velocity and concentration fields. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach is used to evaluate profiles of fluid velocities and concentrations in water, and several important turbulence statistics have been evaluated without using turbulent closures, and subgrid-scale models. We assume that a fluid flow in the water phase is a well-developed turbulent water layer of a low Reynolds number, and the Schmidt number is varied from 1 to 8 to observe the effects of the molecular diffusion of the gas in sub-interface water on the gas exchange rate at the interface. Six degrees of the nondimensional chemical reaction rate are used to find the effect of the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms.

The post-functionalization of synthetic polymers is an important feature of macromolecular engineering as many polymerization mechanisms are rather sensitive to the presence of bulky or functional groups. For example, a wide variety of telechelic polymers (i.e polymers with defined chain-ends) can be efficiently prepared using a combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and CuAAC. This strategy was independently reported in early 2005 by van Hest and Opsteen [31], Lutz et\u00a0al. [32], and Matyjaszewski et\u00a0al. Such step was important since ATRP is a very popular polymerization method in modern materials science [34,35]. Indeed, ATRP is a facile technique, which allows the preparation of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, predictable chain length, controlled microstructure, defined chain-ends and controlled architecture [36\u201341]. However, the range of possibilities of ATRP can be further broadened by CuAAC. For instance, the \u03c9-bromine chain-ends of polymers prepared by ATRP can be transformed into azides by nucleophilic substitution and subsequently reacted with functional alkynes (Scheme 3) [32]. Due to the very high chemoselectivity of CuAAC, this method is highly modular and may be used to synthesize a wide range of \u03c9-functional polymers.

By dividing the algorithm-predicted series of lag values into monthly sets and examining the frequency distribution of the lags, certain patterns in these temporally patchy series have been identified. A challenging task in relation to time lags between observed and simulated daily data, is to determine their cause. This task becomes more difficult for model outputs such as soil N2O emissions that are driven by various interacting variables. Even more so, because the measured N2O datasets and the measured datasets of their drivers ( soil moisture, soil N content) cover small time periods, they are not continuous and can vary widely in size.

However, the fractional values of the fermionic charge have interesting consequence for the fate of the soliton if the latter is not strictly stable.

Using STEM measurements of the thickness of each layer (on the a-plane) through the thickness of the stack, we calculate a new model (green curve) in which the overall reflectivity is reduced to 85%. This implies that variations in layer thickness through the stack are the main source of the reduced reflectivity in comparison to the model. In fact, a closer look at the cross-sectional STEM data and a careful extraction of layer thickness have revealed that whilst the layer thicknesses are fairly consistent through the DBR stack in the wing regions, there is a monotonic variation in the measured layer thicknesses in the window regions. (The GaN layer width smoothly increases, while the AlN layer thickness decreases through the DBR stack.). This observation could potentially be of practical importance, for samples grown on templates with a uniform defect density, as one could achieve much better reflectivities simply by altering the growth time to counteract the change in growth rate.

Rather than to attempt to suppress the emergence of the informal organisation the company decided to channel the energies of staff involved in informal processes towards organisational goals. The company achieved this by harnessing the capabilities of what we term a hybrid ERP system, combining the functionality of a traditional (formal) ERP installation with the capabilities of Enterprise Social Software (ESS). However the company recognised that the successful operation of the hybrid ERP system would require a number of changes in organisational design in areas such as reporting structures and communication channels. A narrative provided by interviews with company personnel is thematised around the formal and informal characteristics of the organisation as defined in the literature.

The reader is referred to several reviews on the topic which describe the various stages of its development and the multiple versions available [50\u201353]. The fundamental difference between the versions is in the underlying intermolecular potential employed to describe the unbounded constituent particles. Hard spheres, square well fluids, LJ fluids, argon, alkanes have all been employed as reference fluids in the different incarnations of SAFT. For the purpose of this work we will center on a particular version of the SAFT EoS, i.e the SAFT-VR Mie recently proposed by Laffitte  [54] and expanded into a group contribution approach, SAFT-\u03b3, by Papaioannou  [55]. This particular version of SAFT provides a closed form EoS that describes the macroscopical properties of the Mie potential [56], also known as the (m,n) potential; a generalized form of the LJ potential (albeit predating it by decades). The Mie potential has the form(1)\u03d5(r)=C\u03b5\u03c3r\u03bbr\u2212\u03c3r\u03bbawhere C is an analytical function of the repulsive and attractive exponents, \u03bba and \u03bbr, respectively, \u03c3 is a parameter that defines the length scale and is loosely related to the average diameter of a Mie bead; \u025b defines the energy scale and corresponds to the minimum potential energy between two isolated beads; expressed here as a ratio to the Boltzmann constant, kB.

It exploits the tensor-product structure of 2- or 3-dimensional NURBS objects to parameterize the physical domain. Hence the physical domain is parameterized with respect to a rectangle or to a cube. Consequently, singularly parameterized NURBS surfaces and NURBS volumes are needed in order to represent non-quadrangular or non-hexahedral domains without splitting, thereby producing a very compact and convenient representation.The Galerkin projection introduces finite-dimensional spaces of test functions in the weak formulation of partial differential equations. In particular, the test functions used in isogeometric analysis are obtained by composing the inverse of the domain parameterization with the NURBS basis functions. In the case of singular parameterizations, however, some of the resulting test functions do not necessarily fulfill the required regularity properties. Consequently, numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations cannot be applied properly.We discuss the regularity properties of the test functions. For one- and two-dimensional domains we consider several important classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations. For specific cases we derive additional conditions which guarantee the regularity of the test functions.

In addition, refined and site-specific data are often not available requiring the use of regional data collected from literature and professional judgement in order to run the model. To ignore the effects of these uncertainties on predictions may make interpretation of the results and subsequent decision making misleading since the likelihood and probabilities of predicted outcomes would be unknown. A unique capability of the current version of SLAMM is the ability to aggregate multiple types of input-data uncertainty to create outputs accompanied by probability statements and confidence intervals. Uncertainty in elevation data layers have been considered by several modeling groups to various extents (Gesch, 2009; Gilmer and Ferda\u00f1a, 2012; Schmid et\u00a0al., 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, no other marsh migration model simultaneously accounts for the combined effects of uncertainty in spatial inputs (DEM, VDATUM, etc.) and parameter choices (accretion rates, tide ranges, etc.) This added feature of SLAMM allows results to be evaluated in terms of their likelihood of occurrence with respect to input-data and parameter uncertainties. Further, by assigning wide ranges of uncertainty when appropriate, it permits the production of meaningful projections in areas where high-quality local data are not available.", "keyphrases": ["slr", "paramet choic", "landcov project", "present and discuss the applic of slamm to the new york coast", "spatial input", "marsh migrat model", "accret rate", "tide rang", "high-qual local data", "dem", "vdatum", "slamm"]}

{"file_name": "S0370269304009359", "text": "Table 1 lists 8 pairs of B decays. In fact, there are more decay pairs, since many of the particles in the final states can be observed as either pseudoscalar\u00a0(P) or vector\u00a0(V) mesons. Note that certain decays are written in terms of VV final states, while others are have PP\u00a0states. There are three reasons for this. First, some decays involve a final-state\u00a0\u03c00. However, experimentally it will be necessary to find the decay vertices of the final particles. This is virtually impossible for a\u00a0\u03c00, and so we always use a\u00a0\u03c10. Second, some pairs of decays are related by SU(3) in the SM only if an (ss\u00af) quark pair is used. However, there are no P's which are pure (ss\u00af). The mesons \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 have an (ss\u00af) component, but they also have significant (uu\u00af) and (dd\u00af) pieces. As a result the b\u00af\u2192s\u00af and b\u00af\u2192d\u00af decays are not really related by SU(3) in the SM if the final state involves an \u03b7 or\u00a0\u03b7\u2032. We therefore consider instead the vector meson \u03d5 which is essentially a pure (ss\u00af) quark state. Finally, we require that both B0 and B\u00af0 be able to decay to the final state. This cannot happen if the final state contains a single K0 (or K\u00af0) meson. However, it can occur if this final-state particle is an excited neutral kaon. In this case one decay involves K*0, while the other has K\u00af*0. Assuming that the vector meson is detected via its decay to \u03c8Ks\u03c00 (as in the measurement of sin2\u03b2 via Bd0(t)\u2192J/\u03c8K*), then both B0 and B\u00af0 can decay to the same final state.", "keyphrases": ["b decay", "\u03b7", "\u03c8ks\u03c00", "meson", "measur of sin2\u03b2", "final particl", "excit neutral kaon", "b0", "quark pair", "find the decay vertic", "decay", "decay pair", "quark", "k\u00af*0", "vector meson", "\u03d5", "quark state", "decay to the final state", "decay to \u03c8ks\u03c00", "final-st particl", "\u03b7\u2032", "k*0", "sm", "pair of decay", "b\u00af0"]}

In DPD, each body is regarded as a coarse-grained particle. These particles interact in a soft (and short-ranged) potential, allowing larger integration timesteps than would be possible in MD, while simultaneously decreasing the number of degrees of freedom required. As in Langevin dynamics, a thermostat consisting of well-balanced damping and stochastic terms is applied to each particle. However, unlike in Langevin dynamics, both terms are pairwise and the damping term is based on relative velocities, leading to the conservation of both the angular momentum and the linear momentum. The property of Galilean invariance (i.e., the dependence on the relative velocity) makes DPD a profile-unbiased thermostat (PUT) [6,7] by construction and thus it is an ideal thermostat for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [8]. The momentum is expected to propagate locally (while global momentum is conserved) and thus the correct hydrodynamics is expected in DPD [8], as demonstrated previously in [9]. Due to the aforementioned properties, DPD has been widely used to recover thermodynamic, dynamical, and rheological properties of complex fluids, with applications in polymer solutions [10], colloidal suspensions [11], multiphase flows [12], and biological systems [13].

Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice is dependant on the required lateral (x, y) and axial (z) resolution, and the size of the structure of interest. Historically, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was the tool of choice for ultrastructural examination of biomedical specimens at sub-nanometer resolution. However, for many cell biology studies structural resolution is actually limited by the deposition of heavy metals onto membranes during sample preparation. In addition, voxel dimensions may only need to be half that of the smallest expected feature of interest (Briggman and Bock, 2012). Advances in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technology are now driving a paradigm shift in electron imaging. SEMs with field emission electron sources and high efficiency electron detectors can achieve lateral resolutions in the order of 3nm, allowing visualisation of structures such as synaptic vesicles and membranes (De Winter , 2009; Knott , 2008; Vihinen , 2013; Villinger , 2012), though resolving individual leaflets of membrane bilayers remains a challenge (Vihinen , 2013).

Minimizing the sum of different objectives is problematic, since they may have different units and ranges. Even with an appropriate scaling procedure there is a risk of treating the objectives unequally or getting trapped in a local minimum. Firstly, we can never know, what is the minimum value of each objective that can be achieved by the regression. Thus, designing an appropriate scaling procedure is difficult and one would need to decide on the relative importance of the different objectives in advance. Secondly, adding multiple, conflicting objectives very likely results in a fitness function with multiple local minima, which makes optimization more difficult. To avoid these problems, we have implemented fitness calculation according to the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) by Zitzler and Thiele (1999), instead of using a single (weighted) fitness or cost function.

This contribution, which can be regarded as an extension of the methods developed in [23], presents several novel aspects over similar approaches proposed in the literature. Firstly, the initiation and propagation of fatigue crack is modeled efficiently by means of cohesive zone elements [24\u201326]. The application of this class of elements allows modeling the crack initiation and propagation within a unified framework. It should be noted that cohesive zone elements have already been used for uncertainty quantification of the crack propagation phenomenon [27,28]. However its application within the context of maintenance scheduling constitutes a novelty. The second innovative aspect of this contribution refers to the assessment of the reliability sensitivity with respect to the variables that define the maintenance scheduling. The estimation of this sensitivity, which is required in order to determine the optimal maintenance schedule within the proposed framework, can be quite demanding as the model characterizing repair of a cracked structure leads to a discontinuous performance function associated with the failure probability.

In particular, we found that dynamic aggregation of models built from very little extracted data by D-SDC is effective for compatibility of high prediction performance and low computational complexity. However, there are problems to be solved in SW-SVR. Firstly, the prediction performance of SW-SVR sometimes deteriorates despite an increase of training data. In particular, this problem occurred under the conditions that prediction horizons are 6 h as shown in Figure 3. This is because data extracted by D-SDC involves unnecessary training data for highly accurate prediction. If D-SDC extracts the same data as the extracted data when training periods are shorter, the prediction performance of SW-SVR never deteriorates due to an increase of training data. Therefore, we must review both feature mapping and algorithms of D-SDC so as to avoid extracting unnecessary training data. Meanwhile, SW-SVR is based on a combination of several algorithms: kernel approximation, PLS regression, k-means, D-SDC, and linear SVR. Moreover, each algorithm has several parameters. Therefore, SW-SVR has more varied parameters, and it takes more time to tune the parameters. In this experiment, we used a grid search roughly so as to decide the parameters in a certain time.

Increasing the order of the geometry parametrisation reduces the geometric error.

The original picture [1] (see also [2] for a modern review) assumes that charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary nucleon\u2013nucleon collisions. During the subsequent evolution of the system, the number of hidden charm mesons is reduced because of: (a)\u00a0absorption of pre-resonance charmonium states by nuclear nucleons (normal nuclear suppression), (b)\u00a0interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons (comovers), (c)\u00a0dissociation of cc\u0304 bound states in deconfined medium (anomalous suppression).

At one extreme where no correlations and therefore no redundancy are present (Poissonian sequence), there is no possibility of detecting one missing level. At the other extreme, a sequence of equally spaced levels (picket fence), there is a maximum redundancy and a missed level can be obviously detected as a hole in the spectrum. Eigenvalues of random matrices, which exhibit characteristic correlations, correspond to an intermediate situation between these two extremes. The attempts to locate in the last case a single missed level have remained unsuccessful so far. However, it should be mentioned that for two-dimensional chaotic systems where, besides correlations of the order of one mean spacing as described by random matrices, the presence and the role of long range correlations governed by the shortest periodic orbits and reflected in Weyl's law describing the average spectral density, is well understood.

Understanding the mechanisms that control SCC in this alloy will allow for continued extensions of life in current plant as well as safer designs of future nuclear reactors.", "keyphrases": ["pressur water reactor", "intergranular stress corros crack", "alloy", "safeti critic compon", "plant", "pressur instrument penetr", "pwscc", "stainless steel", "heater sleev", "structur compon", "74% ni, 16% cr and 8% fe", "control rod drive mechan", "pwr", "scc", "failur of structur compon", "alloy 600", "safer design of futur nuclear reactor", "nuclear reactor", "igscc", "steam gener tube", "stress corros crack", "pressuris water reactor"]}
